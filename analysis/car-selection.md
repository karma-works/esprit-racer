This image is a nostalgic trip back to the early 1990s, specifically featuring the car selection screen from the classic racing game **Lotus III: The Ultimate Challenge**. It showcases the **Lotus Esprit S4** in a vibrant purple finish, presented with the pixelated aesthetic characteristic of the 16-bit era (Amiga/DOS).

The interface is organized into several distinct sections within a dark green and grey frame:

### **1. Top Section: Vehicle Profile**

* **Main Display:** A large, side-profile pixel art rendering of a purple **Lotus Esprit S4**. It features silver multi-spoke rims and the iconic low-profile, wedge-shaped silhouette of the British sports car.
* **Navigation:** Silver arrow buttons ("Left" and "Right") sit on either side of the "SELECT A CAR" header, indicating other vehicles are available.

### **2. Middle Section: Statistics & Performance**

* **Model Identification:** The text **"ESPRIT S4"** is displayed in a bold, futuristic font next to a smaller, 3/4 view sprite of the car.
* **Technical Specs:**
* **Max Speed:** 164 MPH
* **0-60:** 4.7 Seconds
* **Max Power:** 264 BHP
* **Max Torque:** 261 LB FT


* **Performance Bars:** A set of five red bars labeled **SP** (Speed), **AC** (Acceleration), **HA** (Handling), **RD** (Road Holding), and **BR** (Braking). Most bars are nearly full, though "HA" and "BR" show slight blue segments at the top, indicating they aren't quite at the maximum possible rating.
* **Acceleration Graph:** On the right, a line graph plots speed (MPH) against time (SECS). It shows various colored curves (white, blue, orange, green) representing different gears and their acceleration profiles over a 60-second span.

### **3. Bottom Section: Details & Interior**

Four small rectangular thumbnails provide "close-up" looks at the car's features:

* **Steering Wheel:** A view of the dashboard and the three-spoke steering wheel with the yellow Lotus logo.
* **Interior:** A look at the light grey leather seats and the gear shifter.
* **Engine:** A top-down view of the engine bay, featuring purple accents to match the exterior.
* **Rear View:** A close-up of the rear wheel well and part of the iconic taillight assembly.
