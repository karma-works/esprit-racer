The game features **13 distinct environments** (often called themes or scenarios), which serve as the "levels." Here is a breakdown of their characteristics, colors, and atmosphere:

### **The Environments (Level Themes)**

| Level Theme | Atmosphere & Characteristics | Dominant Colors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Night** | Moody and fast; the most popular track. Features a Manhattan-style skyline. | **Black, Navy Blue, Neon Yellow** |
| **Fog** | Tense and claustrophobic. Visibility is cut down to just a few feet in front of the car. | **Grey, Muted Green, White** |
| **Snow** | Slippery and bright. The car skids easily on ice patches and snowdrifts. | **Crisp White, Pale Blue** |
| **Storm** | Intense and chaotic. Features flashing lightning effects and heavy rain puddles. | **Dark Purple, Slate Grey** |
| **Desert** | Hot and hazardous. Sand at the edges slows you down; heat haze atmosphere. | **Orange, Tan, Bright Yellow** |
| **Future** | Sci-fi vibe. High-speed "turbo zones" and laser obstacles on the road. | **Electric Blue, Chrome, Magenta** |
| **Marsh** | Slippery and "dirty." Oil and water on the track make handling very difficult. | **Brown, Deep Green, Murky Teal** |
| **Mountains** | Precarious. Narrow roads with a rock wall on one side and a sheer drop on the other. | **Earth Tones, Stone Grey** |
| **Lakes** | Scenic but tricky. Requires jumping across rivers and dodging oil slicks. | **Bright Blue, Lush Green** |
| **Country** | Relaxed but winding. Features logs, rocks, and fords (water crossings). | **Green, Brown, Sky Blue** |
| **City** | Urban and busy. A wide motorway where you must dodge oncoming traffic. | **Grey (Asphalt), Red/Yellow (Lights)** |
| **Roadworks** | Frantic. Filled with bollards and road signs that zip past at high speed. | **Safety Orange, Black, White** |
| **Windy** | Open and quirky. Tumbleweeds blow across the road, pushing your car. | **Dusty Brown, Pale Yellow** |

### **Atmosphere and Gameplay Experience**

* **The "Feel":** Unlike modern racers, *Lotus III* uses a 2.5D sprite-scaling engine. This creates a rhythmic, high-speed atmosphere where the "vibe" changes drastically based on the weather effects (rain, snow, fog).
* **The Soundtrack:** The atmosphere is heavily defined by its music. Before a race, you choose a track on the "Car Stereo." The music is classic Amiga-style synth-pop/techno (composed by Patrick Phelan), which gives the game a cool, early-90s "supercar" energy.
* **RECS (The Customizer):** A standout feature was the **Racing Environment Construction Set**. It allowed you to generate your own levels by adjusting sliders for things like "Curviness," "Hills," and "Obstacles." Each combination generated a specific code you could share with friends.
