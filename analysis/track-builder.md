This image is a user interface (UI) for a **track builder** or level generator, featuring a retro, 16-bit pixel art aesthetic. The menu is composed of various gray metallic boxes with red progress bars and stylized icons against a dark, scan-line textured background.

The interface is organized into several functional sections:

### Top Navigation & Identification

* **Type:** On the left, a box shows two yellow line-art icons. One is a **winding, squiggly line** (representing a point-to-point track) and the other is a **closed loop** (representing a circuit). The circuit icon is highlighted.
* **Exit:** A central box features a **white checkered flag** on a pole, likely the button to finish or exit the builder.
* **Code:** On the right, a text box displays a unique alphanumeric seed: `I MXFSFK0-69`.

### Adjustment Sliders

There are nine primary sliders arranged in a 3x3 grid, each featuring a red bar indicating the current value between "MIN" and "MAX."

| **Hills** | 64% | Moderate elevation changes. |
| **Scenery** | 64% | Moderate density of environmental assets. |
| **Sharpness** | 24% | Relatively wide, gentle turns. |
| **Steepness** | 36% | Low to moderate incline grades. |
| **Scatter** | **100%** | **Highlighted with a red selection border;** maximum distribution of items. |
| **Length** | 0% | The shortest possible track length. |

### Scenario Selection (Bottom Bar)

A long horizontal tray at the bottom contains 13 dark, silhouetted icons representing different environmental themes or biomes. From left to right, these include:

* A city skyline/castle.
* A planet with a ring (Space).
* A crescent moon.
* A stylized explosion or crystal formation.
* A mountain or large rock.
* A tree with a cloud.

* A cloud over a small hill.
* A simple circular bush or mound.
* A large deciduous tree.
* A Torii gate or Japanese-style structure.
* A windsock on a pole.
* A dense, rounded tree.

### Visual Style

The overall color palette is dominated by **shades of gray, black, and a deep crimson red**. The font is a blocky, white sans-serif common in retro-style arcade games. A faint circular watermark or logo is visible in the bottom right corner behind the "Obstacles" box.
