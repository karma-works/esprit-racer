This image is a collection of three distinct horizontal banners or layers, designed in a simple, vibrant cartoon style. It appears to be a set of assets for a 2D game background or a website header.

The composition is split vertically into three sections, separated by large white spaces:

### 1. The Rolling Hills (Top)

The top section features a **bright green landscape** with soft, rounded hills.

* **Coloring:** It uses a smooth linear gradient that transitions from a very light, lime green at the peaks to a deeper, solid green at the base.
* **Shape:** The horizon line is a gentle wave, suggesting a lush, grassy mountain range or rolling countryside.

### 2. The Sky (Middle)

The middle section depicts a **clear blue sky** with a minimalist aesthetic.

* **Coloring:** Like the hills, it features a gradient that fades from a bright sky blue at the top down to pure white at the bottom.
* **Details:** Scattered across the blue area are several small, stylized **white clouds**. These clouds are "fluffy" in shape with soft grey drop-shadows beneath them to give a slight sense of depth against the sky.

### 3. The Grass/Forest Border (Bottom)

The bottom section is a **dark green silhouette** representing a closer foreground element.

* **Coloring:** This section is a solid, dark forest green with no gradient, providing a sharp contrast to the lighter elements above.
* **Shape:** The top edge is highly textured and jagged, mimicking the appearance of thick grass, bushes, or the tops of a distant treeline.

**Overall Style:**
The image uses clean lines, simple gradients, and no outlines, which is typical of **flat design** or "vector-style" digital art. It is bright, cheerful, and clearly intended to be layered to create a complete landscape.
